this is an app that is more user friendly than systemctl
it focuses on systemd services that the user installs

systemdcontrol can be used to show the status of services the user is responsible for.
it can do start stop status like systemctl
but also have references to where the service files are
when the service started, uptime

it should be nice UI rendered in a terminal

it's a command line tool.

to install it, run install.sh
